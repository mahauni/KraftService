FIAP Challenge Service
----------------------

Challenge sent by Kraft for a program to store, capture and show about ESG.

This is the service of our application, meaning any database and data manipulation is
going to be managed here.

To make this code run you will have to have for the bare minimum the KraftAPI, but because
its only the minimum, you will have to use Postman or something to make the requests to the API,
but you will be able to see things if you have the KraftApp.<br>

You can clone this repo into your local machine.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mahauni/KraftService
$ cd KraftService
```

To get to full Kraft App you can get the instructions in: https://github.com/mahauni/KraftChallenge
